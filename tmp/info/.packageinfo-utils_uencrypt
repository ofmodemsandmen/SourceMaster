Build-Variant: mbedtls
Section: utils
Category: Base system
Repository: base
Title: Small Decryption utility using mbedTLS
Maintainer: Eneas U de Queiroz <cotequeiroz@gmail.com>
Source: 
License: GPL-2.0-or-later
Type: ipkg
Description:   This is a small encrypton/decryption program. It defaults
  to AES-128-CBC, but supports any encryption provided by
  the crypto library. Even though it can be used for
  non-critical* regular encryption and decryption operations,
  it is included here to unencrypt the configuration from mtd
  on some devices.

  * Key and IV are exposed on cmdline

  This variant uses mbedTLS as crypto provider
