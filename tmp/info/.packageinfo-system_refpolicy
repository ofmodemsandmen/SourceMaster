Description: 	The SELinux Reference Policy project (refpolicy) is a
	complete SELinux policy that can be used as the system
	policy for a variety of systems and used as the basis for
	creating other policies. Reference Policy was originally
	based on the NSA example policy, but aims to accomplish many
	additional goals.

	The current refpolicy does not fully support OpenWRT and
	needs modifications to work with the default system file
	layout. These changes should be added as patches to the
	refpolicy that modify a single SELinux policy.

	The refpolicy works for the most part in permissive
	mode. Only the basic set of utilities are enabled in the
	example policy config and some of the pathing in the
	policies is not correct.  Individual policies would need to
	be tweaked to get everything functioning properly.
