Title: a wrapper library for evdev devices
Maintainer: Daniel Golle <daniel@makrotopia.org>
Source: libevdev-1.13.0.tar.xz
License: MIT
LicenseFiles: COPYING
Type: ipkg
Description:   libevdev is a wrapper library for evdev devices. it moves the common
  tasks when dealing with evdev devices into a library and provides a
  library interface to the callers, thus avoiding erroneous ioctls, etc.

  The eventual goal is that libevdev wraps all ioctls available to
  evdev devices, thus making direct access unnecessary.
