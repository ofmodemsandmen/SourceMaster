# banIP - ban incoming and outgoing IP addresses/subnets via Sets in nftables

## Description
IP address blocking is commonly used to protect against brute force attacks, prevent disruptive or unauthorized address(es) from access or it can be used to restrict access to or from a particular geographic area â€” for example. Further more banIP scans the log file via logread and bans IPs that make too many password failures, e.g. via ssh.  

## Main Features
* banIP supports the following fully pre-configured domain blocklist feeds (free for private usage, for commercial use please check their individual licenses).  
  **Please note:** By default every feed blocks all supported chains. The columns "WAN-INP", "WAN-FWD" and "LAN-FWD" show for which chains the feeds are suitable in common scenarios, e.g. the first entry should be limited to the LAN forward chain - see the config options 'ban\_blockpolicy', 'ban\_blockinput', 'ban\_blockforwardwan' and 'ban\_blockforwardlan' below.  

| Feed                | Focus                          | WAN-INP | WAN-FWD | LAN-FWD | Information                                                   |

* Zero-conf like automatic installation & setup, usually no manual changes needed
* All Sets are handled in a separate nft table/namespace 'banIP'
* Full IPv4 and IPv6 support
* Supports nft atomic Set loading
* Supports blocking by ASN numbers and by iso country codes
* Supports local allow- and blocklist with MAC/IPv4/IPv6 addresses or domain names
* Supports concatenation of local MAC addresses with IPv4/IPv6 addresses, e.g. to enforce dhcp assignments
* All local input types support ranges in CIDR notation
* Auto-add the uplink subnet or uplink IP to the local allowlist
* Provides a small background log monitor to ban unsuccessful login attempts in real-time (like fail2ban, crowdsec etc.)
* Auto-add unsuccessful LuCI, nginx, Asterisk or ssh login attempts to the local blocklist
* Auto-add entire subnets to the blocklist Sets based on an additional RDAP request with the monitored suspicious IP
* Fast feed processing as they are handled in parallel as background jobs (on capable multi-core hardware)
* Per feed it can be defined whether the wan-input chain, the wan-forward chain or the lan-forward chain should be blocked (default: all chains)
* Automatic blocklist backup & restore, the backups will be used in case of download errors or during startup
* Automatically selects one of the following download utilities with ssl support: aria2c, curl, uclient-fetch or full wget
* Provides HTTP ETag or entity tag support to download only ressources that have been updated on the server side, to save bandwith and speed up banIP reloads
* Supports an 'allowlist only' mode, this option restricts internet access from/to a given number of secure websites/IPs
* Deduplicate IPs accross all Sets (single IPs only, no intervals)
* Provides comprehensive runtime information
* Provides a detailed Set report
* Provides a Set search engine for certain IPs
* Feed parsing by fast & flexible regex rulesets
* Minimal status & error logging to syslog, enable debug logging to receive more output
* Procd based init system support (start/stop/restart/reload/status/report/search/survey/lookup)
* Procd network interface trigger support
* Add new or edit existing banIP feeds on your own with the LuCI integrated custom feed editor
* Supports external allowlist URLs to reference additional IPv4/IPv6 feeds
* Supports allowing / blocking of certain VLAN forwards

## Prerequisites
* **[OpenWrt](https://openwrt.org)**, latest stable release or a snapshot with nft/firewall 4 support
* A download utility with SSL support: 'aria2c', 'curl', full 'wget' or 'uclient-fetch' with one of the 'libustream-*' SSL libraries, the latter one doesn't provide support for ETag HTTP header
* A certificate store like 'ca-bundle', as banIP checks the validity of the SSL certificates of all download sites by default
* For E-Mail notifications you need to install and setup the additional 'msmtp' package

**Please note the following:**
* Devices with less than 256Mb of RAM are **_not_** supported
* Any previous installation of ancient banIP 0.7.x must be uninstalled, and the /etc/banip folder and the /etc/config/banip configuration file must be deleted (they are recreated when this version is installed)

## Installation & Usage
* Update your local opkg repository (_opkg update_)
* Install banIP (_opkg install banip_) - the banIP service is disabled by default
* Install the LuCI companion package 'luci-app-banip' (opkg install luci-app-banip)
* It's strongly recommended to use the LuCI frontend to easily configure all aspects of banIP, the application is located in LuCI under the 'Services' menu
* If you're going to configure banIP via CLI, edit the config file '/etc/config/banip' and enable the service (set ban\_enabled to '1'), then add pre-configured feeds via 'ban\_feed' (see the feed list above) and add/change other options to your needs (see the options reference below)
* Start the service with '/etc/init.d/banip start' and check everything is working by running '/etc/init.d/banip status'

## banIP CLI interface
* All important banIP functions are accessible via CLI.
```

list ban_logterm 'SecurityEvent=\"InvalidAccountID\".*RemoteAddress='
```

**allow-/blocklist handling**  
banIP supports local allow and block lists, MAC/IPv4/IPv6 addresses (incl. ranges in CIDR notation) or domain names. These files are located in /etc/banip/banip.allowlist and /etc/banip/banip.blocklist.  
Unsuccessful login attempts or suspicious requests will be tracked and added to the local blocklist (see the 'ban_autoblocklist' option). The blocklist behaviour can be further tweaked with the 'ban_nftexpiry' option.  
Depending on the options 'ban_autoallowlist' and 'ban_autoallowuplink' the uplink subnet or the uplink IP will be added automatically to local allowlist.  
Furthermore, you can reference external Allowlist URLs with additional IPv4 and IPv6 feeds (see 'ban_allowurl').  
Both local lists also accept domain names as input to allow IP filtering based on these names. The corresponding IPs (IPv4 & IPv6) will be extracted and added to the Sets. You can also start the domain lookup separately via /etc/init.d/banip lookup at any time.

**allowlist-only mode**  
banIP supports an "allowlist only" mode. This option restricts the internet access from/to a small number of secure MACs, IPs or domains, and block access from/to the rest of the internet. All IPs and Domains which are _not_ listed in the allowlist (plus the external Allowlist URLs) are blocked.

**MAC/IP-binding**
banIP supports concatenation of local MAC addresses with IPv4/IPv6 addresses, e.g. to enforce dhcp assignments. Following notations in the local allow and block lists are allowed:
```
MAC-address only:
C8:C2:9B:F7:80:12                                  => this will be populated to the v4MAC- and v6MAC-Sets with the IP-wildcards 0.0.0.0/0 and ::/0

MAC-address with IPv4 concatenation:
C8:C2:9B:F7:80:12 192.168.1.10                     => this will be populated only to v4MAC-Set with the certain IP, no entry in the v6MAC-Set

MAC-address with IPv6 concatenation:
C8:C2:9B:F7:80:12 2a02:810c:0:80:a10e:62c3:5af:f3f => this will be populated only to v6MAC-Set with the certain IP, no entry in the v4MAC-Set

MAC-address with IPv4 and IPv6 concatenation:
C8:C2:9B:F7:80:12 192.168.1.10                     => this will be populated to v4MAC-Set with the certain IP
C8:C2:9B:F7:80:12 2a02:810c:0:80:a10e:62c3:5af:f3f => this will be populated to v6MAC-Set with the certain IP

MAC-address with IPv4 and IPv6 wildcard concatenation:
C8:C2:9B:F7:80:12 192.168.1.10                     => this will be populated to v4MAC-Set with the certain IP
C8:C2:9B:F7:80:12                                  => this will be populated to v6MAC-Set with the IP-wildcard ::/0
```

**redirect Asterisk security logs to lodg/logread**  
banIP only supports logfile scanning via logread, so to monitor attacks on Asterisk, its security log must be available via logread. To do this, edit '/etc/asterisk/logger.conf' and add the line 'syslog.local0 = security', then run 'asterisk -rx reload logger' to update the running Asterisk configuration.

**send status E-Mails and update the banIP lists via cron job**  
For a regular, automatic status mailing and update of the used lists on a daily basis set up a cron job, e.g.
```
55 03 * * * /etc/init.d/banip report mail
00 04 * * * /etc/init.d/banip reload
```

**tweaks for low memory systems**  
nftables supports the atomic loading of firewall rules (incl. elements), which is cool but unfortunately is also very memory intensive. To reduce the memory pressure on low memory systems (i.e. those with 256-512Mb RAM), you should optimize your configuration with the following options:  

    * point 'ban_basedir', 'ban_reportdir' and 'ban_backupdir' to an external usb drive
    * set 'ban_cores' to '1' (only useful on a multicore system) to force sequential feed processing
    * set 'ban_splitsize' e.g. to '1000' to split the load of an external Set after every 1000 lines/members
    * set 'ban_reportelements' to '0' to disable the CPU intensive counting of Set elements

**tweak the download options**  
By default banIP uses the following pre-configured download options:
```
    * aria2c: --timeout=20 --retry-wait=10 --max-tries=5 --max-file-not-found=5 --allow-overwrite=true --auto-file-renaming=false --log-level=warn --dir=/ -o
    * curl: --connect-timeout 20 --retry-delay 10 --retry 5 --retry-all-errors --fail --silent --show-error --location -o
    * wget: --no-cache --no-cookies --timeout=20 --waitretry=10 --tries=5 --retry-connrefused --max-redirect=0 -O
    * uclient-fetch: --timeout=20 -O
```
To override the default set 'ban_fetchretry', 'ban_fetchinsecure' or globally 'ban_fetchparm' to your needs.

**send E-Mail notifications via 'msmtp'**  
To use the email notification you must install & configure the package 'msmtp'.  
Modify the file '/etc/msmtprc', e.g.:
```
[...]
defaults
auth            on
tls             on
tls_certcheck   off
timeout         5
syslog          LOG_MAIL
[...]
account         ban_notify
host            smtp.gmail.com
port            587
from            <address>@gmail.com
user            <gmail-user>
password        <password>
```
Finally add a valid E-Mail receiver address.

**change existing banIP feeds or add a new one**  
The banIP default blocklist feeds are stored in an external JSON file '/etc/banip/banip.feeds'. All custom changes should be stored in an external JSON file '/etc/banip/banip.custom.feeds' (empty by default). It's recommended to use the LuCI based Custom Feed Editor to make changes to this file.  
A valid JSON source object contains the following information, e.g.:
```
	[...]
	"tor":{
		"url_4": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SecOps-Institute/Tor-IP-Addresses/master/tor-exit-nodes.lst",
		"url_6": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SecOps-Institute/Tor-IP-Addresses/master/tor-exit-nodes.lst",
		"rule_4": "/^(([0-9]{1,3}\\.){3}(1?[0-9][0-9]?|2[0-4][0-9]|25[0-5])(\\/(1?[0-9]|2?[0-9]|3?[0-2]))?)$/{printf \"%s,\\n\",$1}",
		"rule_6": "/^(([0-9A-f]{0,4}:){1,7}[0-9A-f]{0,4}:?(\\/(1?[0-2][0-8]|[0-9][0-9]))?)$/{printf \"%s,\\n\",$1}",
		"descr": "tor exit nodes",
		"flag": ""
	},
	[...]
```
Add an unique feed name (no spaces, no special chars) and make the required changes: adapt at least the URL, the regex and the description for a new feed. The flag is optional, currently only 'gz' is supported to process archive downloads.
