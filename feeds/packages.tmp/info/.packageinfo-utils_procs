Description:   Procs is a 'ps' command replacement written in Rust, offering 
  enhanced usability and information display. 
  Features include color-coded output, theme auto-detection, advanced
  search, and extended process details
  (TCP/UDP ports, Docker names, I/O throughput).
  It also supports pager functionality, a 'top'-like watch mode, and
  a process tree view​​.
