Description: This is a tool for managing a recorded version number in
setuptools-based python projects. The goal is to remove the tedious and
error-prone "update the embedded version string" step from your release
process. Making a new release should be as easy as recording a new tag
in your version-control system, and maybe making new tarballs.
