Description: respondd is a server distributing information within a network.

For doing so, respondd spawns a UDP socket (in Gluon 1001/udp),
optionally joining a multicast group. When a request is received,
the information requested is transmitted to the requester.

All information is organized in a non-hierarchical namespace.
Each entry identifies a request name (e.g. statistics, nodeinfo, ...)
implemented by at least one "provider" C module. The respond is the
result of merging the outputs of all providers for the given request
name.
