Title: A container init that is so simple it's effectively brain-dead.
Maintainer: Oskari Rauta <oskari.rauta@gmail.com>

Description:   This is a rewrite of initrs in C, because we found that it is not
  possible to statically compile Rust binaries without using musl.
  That was, in turn, a reimplementation of other container inits like
  tini and dumb-init.
