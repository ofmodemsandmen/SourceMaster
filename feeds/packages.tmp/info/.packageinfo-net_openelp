Description:   OpenELP is an open source EchoLink proxy for Linux and Windows. It aims
  to be efficient and maintain a small footprint, while still implementing
  all of the features present in the official EchoLink proxy.

  OpenELP also has the ability to bind to multiple network interfaces
  which are routed to unique external IP addresses, and therefore is
  capable of accepting connections from multiple clients simultaneously.
