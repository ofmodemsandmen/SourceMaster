Description: Setuptools is a fully-featured, actively-maintained, and stable library
designed to facilitate packaging Python projects.

It helps developers to easily share reusable code (in the form of a
library) and programs (e.g., CLI/GUI tools implemented in Python), that
can be installed with pip and uploaded to PyPI.

This is the pkg_resources module of setuptools.
