Description:   bpfcountd was created to obtain packet statistics in larger networks
  without stressing the cpu resources. bpfcountd will count the amount
  of packages and bytes over time (for each defined rule). The rules
  are defined using the tcpdump filter syntax (bpf). The collected
  data is provided on a unix socket in plaintext.
