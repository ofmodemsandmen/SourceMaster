Description: Mako is a template library written in Python. It provides a familiar,
non-XML syntax which compiles into Python modules for maximum
performance. Mako's syntax and API borrows from the best ideas of many
others, including Django templates, Cheetah, Myghty, and Genshi.
Conceptually, Mako is an embedded Python (i.e. Python Server Page)
language, which refines the familiar ideas of componentized layout and
inheritance to produce one of the most straightforward and flexible
models available, while also maintaining close ties to Python calling
and scoping semantics.
