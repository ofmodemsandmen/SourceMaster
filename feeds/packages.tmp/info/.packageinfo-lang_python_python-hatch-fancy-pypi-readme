Description: hatch-fancy-pypi-readme is a Hatch metadata plugin for everyone who
cares about the first impression of their project’s PyPI landing page.
It allows you to define your PyPI project description in terms of
concatenated fragments that are based on static strings, files, and most
importantly: parts of files defined using cut-off points or regular
expressions.

Once you’ve assembled your readme, you can additionally run regular
expression-based substitutions over it. For instance to make relative
links absolute or to linkify users and issue numbers in your changelog.
