Description: This tool allows for acquiring the current time from
the cellular network for configuring the local clock.
Compared to NTP, this has the advantage of nut using up
mobile traffic.

It takes advantage of the AT+QLTS command found on Quectel
modems. This functionality depends on support of the mobile
network.
