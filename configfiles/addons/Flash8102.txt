Flashing the ZBT Z8102AX
========================
There are two different versions of the Z8102AX that require different firmware.
You can not tell which version you have by looking at the case or the
board inside.

The only way to tell is to check for a bootloader Recovery GUI. To do this :

1. Power down the router and hold in the Reset button.
2. While holding in the button power up the router again.
3. Hold the button in for 10 seconds and then release.
4. Use your browser to go to 192.168.1.1
5. If you see a GUI that is for flashing firmware then you have the V2 model.
	If there is no GUI and the router continues to boot up normally
	you have the V1 model.
	
Choose the correct firmware from the ZBT-Z8102AX-V1 folder for the V1 model
and from the ZBT-Z8102AX-V2 folder for the V2 model.

Be sure to only use the correct firmware as flashing the V2 firmware on
the V1 router will brick it and require a Serial cable to recover it.
Because the V2 router has a Recovery GUI it can be used to recover from
an incorrect firmware.


To flash from factory to ROOter go to the System->Backup/Flash
menu and flash from there.

If your router has the Intelligent Router factory firmware then you
have to use the Recovery GUI from above to flash it.

Be sure to deselect Keep Settings and select Force Flash.
