The WG1602 can have either 2 internal PCie interfaces or
a single internal PCie interface and the external USB port.
It can not have all three together.

By default the firmware is set to have 2 internal PCie interfaces
and no USB port. This can be changed by going to System->USB Configuration
and selecting which set up you want.
