Flashing ROOter
-----------------------

When flashing from the factory firmware use the image with "factory"
in its name if one exists. Otherwise use the one with "upgrade"
in its name.

When upgrading ROOter to a new version use the image with "upgrade"
in its name only.

Images with "full" in their name will have Load Balancing included.
Those without do not have Load Balancing.

When you first flash the router and go to log in to the GUI your browser
may give you a warning saying it was dangerous, certificate warning etc.
This is due to the router having a self signed certificate and you have to
accept this. There is no danger in doing this as it is something that
browsers do when the device uses http and the browser wants https.
